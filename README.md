Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

**Software engineering** is the systematic and quantifiable application of engineering principles to develop, operate, and maintain software. (Introduction to Software Engineering- Software Engineering, 2024) [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-introduction-to-software-engineering/](https://)

It includes the entire process of software development such as; getting the requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance while traditional programming involves writing code to solve specific problems without including the other aspects e.g. planning.

**Differences between software engineering and traditional programming**
Software engineering uses a systematic and structured approach with methodologies such as Agile, Waterfall, DevOps while traditional programming is usually informal and may lack extensive documentation.

Software engineering involves a team of various roles while traditional programming may be done by individuals or small teams that do not require a lot of collaboration.

Software engineering includes a lot of testing, code reviews, and quality assurance practices while traditional programming usually has minimal or informal testing, with less emphasis on ensuring code quality and reliability.

In software engineering, extensive documentation is done as opposed to traditional engineering where documentation is often limited, focusing mainly on code comments and basic user instructions.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a framework that defines the steps involved in the development of software from inception to retirement. (Software Development Life Cycle, n.d.)[ https://www.javatpoint.com/software-engineering-software-development-life-cycle ](https://)

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

**Planning**- Involves gathering and analyzing the requirements from stakeholders to ensure that the development team understands what the users need.

**Requirements definition**- Create software-specific requirements based on the information gathered by the team from stakeholders.

**System design**- Based on the requirements, the system's architecture and design are created. This includes both high-level design (HLD) and detailed design (DDL).

**Coding**- The actual coding of the software takes place in this phase. Developers write code based on the design specifications.

**Testing**- The software is tested to identify and fix defects to ensure that the software functions as intended and meets the specified requirements.

**Deployment**- The software is released to the production environment where it becomes accessible to users through installation, configuration, and initial user training.

**Maintenance**- After deployment, the software undergoes continuous maintenance to fix any issues, update features, and improve performance as required.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

**Waterfall Model** is a linear sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. It is simple and easy to manage but inflexible to changes (DeClute, 2022).  
The Waterfall Model may be preferred for projects with regulatory requirements necessitating extensive documentation. For example, preliminary designs of a rocket or an aircraft software or designs should be approved before the conceptual designs are done and thereafter detailed designs are completed and approved. Additionally, large scale projects such as nationwide internet connection may benefit from Waterfall model since Sequential execution ensures network reliability and coverage to prevent huge losses.

**Agile Model**- An iterative and incremental approach where there is a rapid delivery of small functional pieces of the software. 
The Agile model may be used for projects that that prioritize customer feedback and iterative improvement for product testing before applications are rolled out or where project requirements are highly dynamic or not well-understood at the beginning of the project. 
Projects such as start-up mobile apps or e-commerce platforms may benefit from Agile model due to early delivery of partial solutions to gather real-world feedback. 
Agile model should also be used for projects that requires frequent engagement between the software developers and the project stakeholders.

**Key differences between Agile and Waterfall**
•	Agile is highly flexible and adaptive to changes throughout the development process while Waterfall is inflexible; changes are difficult and costly once a phase is completed.

•	Agile model entails continuous customer involvement and feedback while feedback and customer involvement is limited in Waterfall model after the requirements phase.

•	In the Agile model, there is incremental delivery of functional software in sprints while in the Waterfall model there is a delivery of the final product at the end of the project.

•	Agile is better suited for complex, uncertain projects where requirements may evolve while Waterfall is better suited for simple, well-understood projects with stable requirements.

•	In the Agile model, there is early and continuous identification and mitigation of risks through iterative development while in the Waterfall method, risks are often identified and addressed late in the development cycle.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

**Requirements engineering** is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the parameters in the engineering design process which form the basis of all subsequent processes of software development.

**Process of Requirements Engineering**
•	**Requirements collection**- This involves gathering requirements from stakeholders, including customers, users, and other relevant parties through the use of interviews, questionnaires, observations, workshops, brainstorming sessions, and use case development to obtain a list of requirements.
•	**Requirements analysis**- Data obtained is refined the gathered requirements to ensure they are complete, clear, consistent, and feasible through activities such as feasibility studies and modeling to get a detailed and prioritized list of requirements.
•	**Specification**- The analyzed requirements in a clearly documented to provide a detailed description of requirements understood by all stakeholders to obtain a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
•	**Validation**- This is ensuring the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholders' needs and are feasible within project constraints by carrying out activities such as creating prototypes, doing inspections and considering reviews.
•	**Management**- This involves maintaining and managing requirement changes throughout the project by using techniques such as traceability and impact analysis.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

**Modularity** is a design principle involving division a software system into distinct, self-contained units called modules with each of the module encapsulating a specific piece of functionality and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces.

**How Modularity Improves Maintainability**
•	Modularity enables **easier troubleshooting** by isolating issues within a single module simplifies debugging. This allows developers to focus on a specific module without being overwhelmed by the entire system.
•	Modularity allows for **simplified testing** since modules can be tested individually (unit testing), ensuring that each part of the system works correctly before integration. 
•	Modularity enables **independent updates** as changes in one module can be made without affecting other parts of the system and thus reduces the risk of introducing new bugs when modifying or extending functionality.
•	Modularity allows for **improved code comprehension**. Smaller, self-contained modules are easier to understand and maintain. Developers can quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of a module without delving into unrelated parts of the system.


**How Modularity Improves Scalability**
•	**Parallel Development** is enabled since different teams can work on different modules simultaneously, speeding up development time.
•	**Easier resource allocation** since modules can be deployed on different servers or computing resources to enable the system to scale horizontally. For example, a web application can scale its frontend and backend modules independently based on demand.
•	Modules designed for one project can often be **reused** in other projects, reducing development time and effort. Reusable modules are especially useful in large organizations with multiple projects.
•	**Load Distribution can be easily done** as systems can distribute the load across multiple modules. For instance, a micro services architecture leverages modularity to distribute different services across multiple nodes, enhancing the system’s ability to handle increased load.
•	Modular systems are **flexible** and can be **more easily adapted** to new requirements or technologies. New modules can be added, or existing modules can be upgraded or replaced without overhauling the entire system.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

**Unit Testing**
Involves testing that individual units or components of the software function correctly in isolation. It focuses on the smallest testable parts of the software, such as functions, methods, or classes and is usually done by developers during the development phase. Unit testing ensures early detection of bugs thus ensures the code works as expected before final integration and simplifies debugging

**Integration Testing**
Involves verification of different modules or components of the software to ensure they work together as expected. Integration testing focuses on the interactions between integrated units or components. Data flows between modules are confirmed and interface errors are identified. Can be done using the Big Bang approach where components are integrated simultaneously and tested as a whole or the incremental approach where components are integrated and tested separately. Integration testing detects interface issues between modules and ensures combined components work together as intended.

**System Testing**
Validates the complete and integrated software system against the specified requirements by testing the entire system as a whole. System testing checks end-to-end flow of the application and is typically performed by professional testing agents using techniques such as functional testing (verifying specific functionalities) and non-functional testing (performance, security, usability). System testing ensures the software meets all requirements and identifies issues that may not have been detected during earlier testing levels.

**Acceptance Testing**
Includes validation of the software against business requirements and ensure it is ready for delivery to the end-users by testing the software from the end-user’s perspective. Usually performed by end-users, clients, or a QA team representing the end-users. There are two types of acceptance testing; user acceptance testing which verifies the software meets the user’s needs and requirements and operational acceptance testing which ensures the software is ready for operational use and performs well in a production-like environment. Acceptance testing ensures the software is fit for purpose and provides confidence to stakeholders that the software is ready for final deployment.

**Importance of Testing in Software Development**
Ensures compliance to quality standards required by regulatory bodies. Many industries have regulatory requirements that necessitate rigorous testing to ensure compliance with standards and legal requirements.

Testing helps ensure the software meets the required quality standards, providing confidence that it will perform reliably and efficiently.

Early and systematic testing ensures early bug detection and thus helps identify and fix defects before the software is deployed, reducing the likelihood of bugs affecting the end-user.

Testing verifies that the software was built correctly and validates that the right product was built, ensuring the software meets both technical specifications and user needs.

Thorough testing helps identify potential issues and risks, allowing them to be addressed before they can cause significant problems in production.

Detecting and fixing issues early in the development process is generally less expensive than addressing them after deployment. Testing helps reduce the overall cost of software maintenance and support.

Ensuring the software works as intended and is free from major defects enhances user satisfaction and trust in the product.

Regular testing and feedback loops contribute to the continuous improvement of the software development process, leading to better products over time.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

**Version control systems (VCS)** are tools that assist developers to manage changes to source code and other project files over time by keeping track of every modification to the code in a special database.

**Importance of Version Control Systems in Software Development**
VCS enable multiple developers to collaborate and work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. Changes can be merged and conflicts can be resolved.

Release management can be easily done through VCS through tagging specific points in the code as releases, making it easier to manage and deploy software versions.

History tracking enables every change made to the project to be recorded, along with who made the change and why. This historical record is invaluable for understanding the evolution of the code and for debugging.

VCS support branching, allowing developers to create separate branches for features, bug fixes, or experiments. These branches can later be merged back into the main codebase, facilitating parallel development and integration.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is enabled since VCS are integral to modern CI/CD pipelines, where automated tests and deployments are triggered by changes in the repository, ensuring quick and reliable software delivery.

VCS act as a backup system for the code base. Developers can easily recover previous versions from the repository if files are accidentally deleted or corrupted.

**Examples of Popular Version Control Systems and their Features**
